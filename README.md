# mileage
This project focuses on optimising the bus timetables in a city. A number of busses are observed on a day-to-day basis which run with very few number of passengers. Through this project , we aim to identify such buses and check how frequent they are. If a number of such busses are running on the same route, then their timetable is adjusted so that it is optimum.
An app was also developed through which the daily commuters could be notified of any changes a few days before.
This project employs basic data analysis


This project stood 2nd in The software development competition of Mindspark (COEP) 2016
